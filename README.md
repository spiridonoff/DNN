Decentralized Neural Network

This Project creates an object oriented Neuron class to be used in a Decentralized Neural Network. 
This is a fundamentally different approach of conventional neural networks which use Tensors and Matrix Operations to simplify Feed-Forward as well as Back-Propagations.

This can be used to build more sophisticated Neurons and possibly redefine the interactions between them for experimental purposes.
